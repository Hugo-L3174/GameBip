# GameBip

Since this project uses [Lakka](http://www.lakka.tv/) it is able to run on a lightweight Raspberry pi zero2.
The drivers can be adapted and compiled from source for another hardware platform.

## Screen driver
The driver is [fbcp-ili9341](https://github.com/juj/fbcp-ili9341) (see details)

## Buttons driver
Lakka does not allow remapping using python scripts so we will use Adafruit's [Retrogame](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Retrogame)

## config.txt
```shell

```
